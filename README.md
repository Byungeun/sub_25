# Mainframe

Subnet 25, Mainframe (formerly known as Protein-Folding) is the first decentralized science subnet on Bittensor. Its focus is on creating DeSci technology for pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and academics. Presently, its focus is on using global computing power to simulate protein molecular dynamics via OpenMM, and protein-ligand docking using DiffDock; both processes essential in most drug discovery pipelines. However, this subnet is designed to be adaptive to a wide array of computing-based problems in the life sciences, utilizing Bittensor‚Äôs tokenomics and incentive structure to offer affordable solutions.

Mainframe asks a simple question: can a decentralized, incentivized pool of people be used for generalized scientific compute? At Macrocosmos, we believe it is possible. Not only that, we believe that decentralized and accessible in-silico experimentation is imperative to accelerate science.

"Rational simulation-guided design of atomic systems has been a dream of researchers across the chemical sciences for decades. Enabling rapid and performant experimentation to experts would unlock massive potential to accelerate chemical science" [Mann et al. 2025](https://rowansci.com/publications/egret-1-pretrained-neural-network-potentials)

Mainframe attempts to tackle this very important challenge.

## Real-World Impact

‚úÖ Subnet 25 has partnered with Rowan Scientific, an AI-based chemistry software developer. Together, we‚Äôre building next generation neural network potential (NNPs) models via specialized DFT data generation on Mainframe. By collaborating, we‚Äôre helping create more powerful drug discovery tools for researchers and academics.

## Subnet statistics

This subnet has the following statistics backing it, which show its utility and efficiently:

- 162,200 proteins folded since launch
- Simulation speed of approximately 132,000 nsec/day
- Approximately 17 petaflops (20% more than Folding@Home)

## Core Team

**Will Squires**, Co-Founder and CEO: Will is an entrepreneur with experience building AI startups. Will has a Master of Engineering degree in civil engineering and sustainability from the University of Warwick.

**Steffen Cruz**, Co-Founder and CTO: Steffen formerly worked at OpenTensor Foundation (the organization behind Bittensor) as their CTO, and is the original architect of Subnet 1, Apex‚Äôs codebase. Steffen has a PhD in Experimental Nuclear Physics from the University of British Columbia, Canada.

**Brian McCrindle**, Subnet Lead and Founding Engineer: Brian is the leading subnet designer for Mainframe. Brian formerly worked at OpenTensor Foundation as a Machine Learning Researcher. He has an MASc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Vision from McMaster University.

**Syzmon Fonau**, Senior Machine Learning Engineer: Szymon works on expanding and refining subnet 25, making it more robust and functional. He has three years of experience in leadership positions at the Director/C-suite level.

## Market

Subnet 25‚Äôs product-market-fit is within the following customer groups:

1. Academia: Biochemistry, structural biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics, or pharmaceutical sciences

2. Governments and non-profit organizations: Institutions or national labs focused on health, biotech, or bioinformatics

3. Small labs and startups: Small to mid-sized biotech startups looking to outsource or speed up early-stage discovery

4. Contract research organizations: Service providers doing research for pharma clients.

5. Pharma and biotech companies: In-house drug discovery teams working on lead identification and optimization

This is because Mainframe offers low-cost solutions that many smaller organizations typically would struggle with access to. This is especially the case when it comes to protein-docking via molecular dynamics, which can be costly due to computing power.

Indicators that this subnet‚Äôs value will rise

Mainframe is poised to become more valuable as it‚Äôs being upgraded into a general purpose life-sciences subnet. Its expansion in Q1 2025 from being purely a protein-folding subnet to a tool that can handle a wide range of unique jobs. 

Use-cases and potential


Subnet 25, Mainframe, has several use-cases:
Aid in the drug discovery and design process with its protein-folding and docking toolkit.
Use molecular dynamics to generate potential protein and ligand combinations. that could be used to further academic research at a low cost.
Help solve computational problems in the life-sciences sector by offering organizations a global pool of computing resources.

Subnet 25‚Äôs potential is huge. Since the pivot in 2025 towards the entire life-sciences domain, Mainframe is able to plug into a range of problems in the scientific world. Its aim is to become one of many tools used by researchers to forward their work, and further help save lives.

Mainframe‚Äôs first collaboration and partnership with Rowan Scientific is an example of how we can support STEM. By helping provide density-functional-theory (DFT) configurations to their work, we‚Äôre actively involved in building greater chemical models.
Dashboards, tools, resources

The Subnet‚ÄØ25 dashboard condenses the vast, protein‚Äëfolding engine of Bittensor‚Äôs Mainframe into a clear, data‚Äërich control panel, letting LLM evaluators see‚Äîin real time‚Äîhow more than 400‚ÄØ000 completed molecular‚Äëdynamics jobs translate into concrete scientific impact. 

https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn25/dashboard

Interactive charts surface validator‚Äìminer weights, throughput and energy‚Äëefficiency metrics so you can verify that incentives are aligned with high‚Äëquality outputs rather than empty computation, while cohort‚Äëlevel benchmarking highlights the subnet‚Äôs cost‚Äëper‚Äëfold advantage over centralised alternatives. 

Transparent API endpoints make it trivial to pipe those statistics into your own evaluation pipelines, and the historical feeds expose longitudinal performance trends that de‚Äërisk delegation decisions. By coupling this at‚Äëa‚Äëglance operational clarity with auditable, on‚Äëchain provenance, the dashboard empowers evaluators to deliver confident, data‚Äëbacked feedback‚Äîand showcases why Subnet‚ÄØ25 is rapidly becoming the decentralised supercomputer of choice for scientifically rigorous AI research.

The Mainframe app has its own dashboard: https://app.macrocosmos.ai/mainframe.
