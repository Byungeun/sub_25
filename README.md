# The Mission
Mainframe asks a simple question: *could bittensor be used for generalized scientific compute?* We at Macrocosmos believe so. 

"Rational simulation-guided design of atomic systems has been a dream of researchers across the chemical sciences for decades. Enabling rapid and performant experimentation to experts would unlock massive potential to accelerate chemical science" [Mann et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955)

For decentralized science to succeed, we need:
1. Industry/Research collaboration
2. Well defined metrics of success

## Our Principles
- *fast*
- *accurate*
- *scalable*
- *reliable* simulation

## Our Focus
- *molecular dynamics*
- *material propery prediction*
- *model training*

## Our Goals
- academic papers with research groups 
- revenue generating pipelines

## Our Accomplishments (last updated April 30th, 2025)
1. the first desci subnet on bittensor ✅
1. professional and revenue generating collaboration with [Rowan Scientific](https://rowansci.com) to build DTF pipelines on sn25 ✅
