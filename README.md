# Mainframe

</div>

Subnet 25, Mainframe (formerly known as Protein-Folding) is the first decentralized science subnet on Bittensor. Its focus is on creating DeSci technology for pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and academics. Presently, its focus is on using global computing power to simulate protein molecular dynamics via OpenMM, and protein-ligand docking using DiffDock; both processes essential in most drug discovery pipelines. However, this subnet is designed to be adaptive to a wide array of computing-based problems in the life sciences, utilizing Bittensor‚Äôs tokenomics and incentive structure to offer affordable solutions.

Mainframe asks a simple question: can a decentralized, incentivized pool of people be used for generalized scientific compute? At Macrocosmos, we believe it is possible. Not only that, we believe that decentralized and accessible in-silico experimentation is imperative to accelerate science.

"Rational simulation-guided design of atomic systems has been a dream of researchers across the chemical sciences for decades. Enabling rapid and performant experimentation to experts would unlock massive potential to accelerate chemical science" [Mann et al. 2025](https://rowansci.com/publications/egret-1-pretrained-neural-network-potentials)

Mainframe attempts to tackle this very important challenge.

## Real-World Impact

</div>

‚úÖ Subnet 25 has partnered with Rowan Scientific, an AI-based chemistry software developer. Together, we‚Äôre building next generation neural network potential (NNPs) models via specialized DFT data generation on Mainframe. By collaborating, we‚Äôre helping create more powerful drug discovery tools for researchers and academics.

# Subnet statistics

</div>

This subnet has the following statistics backing it, which show its utility and efficiently:

- 162,200 proteins folded since launch üìà
- Simulation speed of approximately 132,000 nsec/day üèéÔ∏è
- Approximately 17 petaflops (20% more than Folding@Home)

# Market

</div>

Subnet 25‚Äôs product-market-fit is within the following customer groups:

1. Academia: Biochemistry, structural biology, computational chemistry, bioinformatics, or pharmaceutical sciences

2. Governments and non-profit organizations: Institutions or national labs focused on health, biotech, or bioinformatics

3. Small labs and startups: Small to mid-sized biotech startups looking to outsource or speed up early-stage discovery

4. Contract research organizations: Service providers doing research for pharma clients.

5. Pharma and biotech companies: In-house drug discovery teams working on lead identification and optimization

This is because Mainframe offers low-cost solutions that many smaller organizations typically would struggle with access to. This is especially the case when it comes to protein-docking via molecular dynamics, which can be costly due to computing power.

# Mainframe Incentive Architecture

</div>

As Mainframe is meant to be a collection of different scientific computation tasks happening in parallel, the result is that there are a collection of incentive mechanisms that must be managed. The sections below outline our current tasks: 

<div align="center">

### Molecular Dynamics üß¨
---

</div>

Physical systems such as proteins tend to minimize their energy and so this provides a succinct, exploit-resistant and highly sensitive measure of quality. For this reason, miners compete to provide protein configurations that coincide with the lowest energy (analogous to loss). The benefit is twofold; the metric the network is optimizing for is highly aligned with the desired outcome (biologically stable structures) and it is transparent and deterministic (both miners and validators can quickly calculate the energy of a configuration).

Miners are currently tasked with finding the lowest free energy solution of the specified configuration. This challenge is placed within the Global Job Pool (GJP) and miners must work on the challenge and post their solutions to S3 for validation. Therefore, all miners have access to all challenges, and thus compete on them accordingly. 

The top-K miners (currently, K = 5) are ranked, where 80% of the reward for that challenge is given to the top miner in the batch, and the remaining 20% is distributed to the (K-1) miners. Therefore, miners not in the top-K set get *no* rewards. 

**Maintaining opportunity:**
-  The miners are oversubscribed to jobs by design, which means there is an effectively unbounded opportunity for those that can handle the enormous computational workload.

**Ensuring innovation:** 
- Each miner uses a separate random seed for their simulations, which ensures that each simulation suitably explores the folding space and utilizes the parallelism opportunity of batching jobs. On job evaluation, if miners are submitting identical results, we enforce that their reward is zero, which continues to incentivize unique solutions.

### Density Functional Theory (DFT) ‚öõÔ∏è

# Subnet Future Value

</div>

Mainframe is poised to become more valuable as it‚Äôs being upgraded into a general purpose life-sciences subnet. Its expansion in Q1 2025 from being purely a protein-folding subnet to a tool that can handle a wide range of unique jobs. 

### Use-cases and potential

Mainframe, has several use-cases:
1. Aid in the drug discovery and design process with its protein-folding and docking toolkit.
Use molecular dynamics to generate potential protein and ligand combinations. that could be used to further academic research at a low cost.

2. Help solve computational problems in the life-sciences sector by offering organizations a global pool of computing resources.

3. Since the pivot in 2025 towards the entire life-sciences domain, Mainframe is able to plug into a range of problems in the scientific world. Its aim is to become one of many tools used by researchers to forward their work, and further help save lives.

4. Mainframe‚Äôs first collaboration and partnership with Rowan Scientific is an example of how we can support STEM. By helping provide density-functional-theory (DFT) configurations to their work, we‚Äôre actively involved in building greater chemical models.
